# Udacity Matching Game Project

This is the repo for my matching game project that is part of Udacity's Front End Developer NanoDegree program.

To win the game, you must correctly match all cards.

All players start with a 3-star rating. After 9 moves, the rating is reduced to 2-stars. After 15 moves, the rating is reduce to 1-star. After 25 moves, no stars are awarded. A move is defined as flipping over two cards.

Matching cards indicated by a shake animation to notify the player of the match.
