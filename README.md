# Udacity Matching Game Project

This is the repo for my matching game project that is part of **Udacity's Front End Developer NanoDegree** program.

## Gameplay

To win the game, you must correctly match all cards.

All players start with a 3-star rating. After 9 moves, the rating is reduced to 2-stars. After 15 moves, the rating is reduced to 1-star. A move is defined as flipping over one card.

Matching cards are indicated by a shake animation to notify the player of the match.

## Dependencies

My game is dependent upon the following items:

- Vectored icons from Font Awesome (https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery)
- Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/)
- Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/)
